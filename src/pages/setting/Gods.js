      <h2>The Lawful Good</h2>
      <p>Living a good and lawful life isn't about living in accordance to the laws of men, but the greater Law, the divine order by which the world was aligned.</p>
      <h2>The Neutral Other</h2>
      <p>Living outside the order of the world but not against it. Living an alien way of life in the lands of Raal.</p>
      <h2>The Chaotic Evil</h2>
      <p>The final conflict that ended the world, cracked the sun, and slew the gods was built on the ultimate rejection of their truth. And the alignment towards chaos of today is built on that opposition.</p>
